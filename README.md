1. Number Guessing Game: This game was designed applying a very simple logic of using the <ctime> and <cstdlib> libraries that made use of the functions like rand() and srand() to generate random numbers and ask the user to guess the number that might have been generated. The program allows the user to keep guessing the number until they have guessed the correct number.
2. Tic Tac Toe: This particular two player game was something I had worked on previously for a group assignment so I just made a few adjustments like adding colors to it. In this game a 3x3 grid appears in front of the user and then two players can add their response using numbers from 1-9.
3. To Do List: This program was designed using multiple functions, string and vector libraries and switch case statements that allows the user to add, remove, review and do much more with their to do list.
4. Calculator: This program was rather easy and basic as it used the most basic functionalities and logic to perform simple arithmetic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
